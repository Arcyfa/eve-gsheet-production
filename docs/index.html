# GSheet EVE Industry Helper
A Google Apps Script helping with keeping industry spreadsheets up to date.

The data is provided by CCP Games in the form og the Static Data Export and converted to MySQL by Steve from Fuzzworks.co.uk, 
the the data is then exported to csv files and is ready to be imported to Google Sheets.

From here you can use the data. When there is an update in the EVE Online Static Data Export the data here will be updated and 
then be made available to your Google Sheet document.

Enjoy uptodate spreadsheets and fly safe o7
